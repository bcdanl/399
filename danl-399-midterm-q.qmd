# Question 1

The following describes the context of the data.frame, **trashwheel**.

## Using The Power of Nature to Clean the Oceans

![Mr. Trash Wheel](https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/MTW-model-2-1024x662.png){fig-align="center"}

Mr. Trash Wheel is a semi-autonomous trash interceptor that is placed at the end of a river, stream or other outfall.

Far too lazy to chase trash around the ocean, Mr. Trash Wheel stays put and waits for the waste to flow to him.

Sustainably powered and built to withstand the biggest storms, Mr. Trash Wheel uses a unique blend of solar and hydro power to pull hundreds of tons of trash out of the water each year.

# Question 4 

In September 2019, YouGov survey asked 1,639 GB adults the following question:

> In hindsight, do you think Britain was right/wrong to vote to leave EU?
>
> -   Right to leave\
> -   Wrong to leave\
> -   Don't know

The data from the survey is in `brexit.csv`.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: true

brexit <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/brexit.csv')
```


<br>

## Q4a

- Replicate the following visualization

```{r a4a}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics('midterm-figs/figure-html/q4a-1.png')
```

<br><br>

## Q4b
- Replicate the following visualization
  - How is the story this visualization telling different than the story the plot in Q4a?


```{r q4b}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics('midterm-figs/figure-html/q4b-1.png')
```

<br><br>

## Q4c

- First, calculate the proportion of wrong, right, and don't know answers in each region and then plot these proportions (rather than the counts) and then improve axis labeling. 

```{r}
#| echo: true
q4 <- brexit |> 
  group_by(region, opinion) |>  
  summarise(n = n()) |> 
  mutate(tot = sum(n),
         prop = n / tot ) 
```



- Replicate the following visualization
  - How is the story this visualization telling different than the story the plot in Q4b?



```{r q4c}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics('midterm-figs/figure-html/q4c-1.png')
```

<br><br>

## Q4d.

- Recreate the same visualization from the previous exercise, this time dodging the bars for opinion proportions for each region, rather than faceting by region and then improve the legend.

  - How is the story this visualization telling different than the story the previous plot tells?

```{r q4d}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics('midterm-figs/figure-html/q4d-1.png')
```
