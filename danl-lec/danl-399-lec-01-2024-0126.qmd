### Economics, Data Science, and Climate Change

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World"

- **Climate finance** refers to the financial resources allocated for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including support for initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts.
  - We focus on transnational financing that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  - Since the GHG emissions in developing countries are rapidly growing, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance.
  - Poor governance can be significant barriers to emissions reductions within these countries.

<!-- ## Syllabus -->
<!-- ### Netiquette Policy for Online Discussions -->

<!-- - Before posting your question to a discussion board, check if anyone has asked it already and received a reply. Just as you would not repeat a topic of discussion right after it happened in real life, do not do that in discussion boards either. -->
<!-- - Stay on topic - Do not post irrelevant inks. comments, thoughts, or pictures. -->
<!-- - Do not type in all capital letters. If you do, it will look like you are screaming. -->
<!-- - Do not write anything that sounds angry or sarcastic, even as a joke, because without hearing your tone of voice, your peers might not realize you are joking. -->
<!-- - Always remember to say "Please" and "Thank you" when soliciting help from your peers or an instructor. -->
<!-- - Respect the opinions of your classmates. If you feel the need to disagree, do so respectfully and acknowledge the valid points in your peers' arguments. Acknowledge that others are entitled to have their own perspective on the issue. -->
<!-- - If you reply to a question from a peer, make sure your answer is accurate! If you are not 100% when the homework is due, do not guess. Otherwise, you could really mess things up for your peers and they will not appreciate it. -->
<!-- - Be brief. If you write a long dissertation in response to a simple question, it is unlikely that anyone will spend the time to read through it all. -->
<!-- - If you ask a question and many people respond, summarize all answers and post that summary to benefit your whole class. -->
<!-- - Do not badmouth others or call them stupid. You may disagree with their ideas, but do not mock the person. -->
<!-- - If you refer to something your peers said earlier in the discussion, quote just a few key lines from their post so that others wont have to go back and figure out which post you re referring to. -->
<!-- - Be forgiving. If your peer makes a mistake, do not badger him or her for it. Just let it go - it happens to the best of us. -->
<!-- - Run a spelling and grammar check before posting anything to the discussion board. It only takes a minute, and can make the difference between sounding like a fool and sounding knowledgeable. -->

### Loading R packages with `library(packageName)`

- Once installed, a package is loaded into an R session using `library(packageName)` so that its functions and data can be used.
  - To load the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following command from a R script:

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
df_mpg <- mpg
```

:::{.incremental}
- `mpg` is the data.frame provided by the R package `ggplot2`, one of the R pakcages in `tidyverse`.
  - Since `tidyverse` is installed, `ggplot2` package is already installed.
